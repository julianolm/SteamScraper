/><br /><br />Two lovers brought together by war, torn between the queen they’ve
sworn fealty to and the charismatic princess who’s risen up to take back the
throne. Civil war engulfs a kingdom as battle lines are drawn and swords
unsheathed.<br /><br />Amidst the conflict, a convergence of fate—a rogue
magician seeking to unravel the land’s secrets meets a young girl, the second
heir to the throne. With the power to create and destroy worlds in their hands,
the two will fight to escape their past and become something more.<br /><br />As
the kingdom burns and powers more ancient than the soil resurface, stand your
ground and fight for the fate of Arcadia!<br /><br /><img

/><br />You’ll need allies you can trust in this endless war. Recruit troops,
customize their classes, and train your army to engage in deep tactical battles.
<br /><br /><strong>CAVALIER TREE</strong> – the powerhouse class, undaunted in
battle with their heavy armors and sharpened swords. Cavaliers can upgrade to
Inquisitors, turning enemies undead and crippling them with Holy attacks; or
Ronins who can enter deadly trances and sacrifice control for huge bonuses on
the battlefield.<br /><br /><strong>WARMANCER TREE</strong> – magicians who have
made pacts with creation’s most basic elements, Warmancers study the ways of
searing flames, slowing ice, or unpredictable lightning to decimate foes. With
enough training they can become Sorcerers, agents of chaos that take magic to
wild extremes on the frontlines; or Druids who have learned to channel powerful
natural forces and lay deadly magic traps.<br /><br /><strong
  >RANGER TREE</strong
>
– lethal at a distance, Rangers seek higher ground and rain down destruction or
fire powerful elemental shots across the battlefield to stun and cripple foes.
Honing their skills can upgrade them to Hunters with the ability to lay traps
and dive bomb unsuspecting troops using their animal companion, or Reavers who
dispatch their foes with a well-placed stab and then disappear into clouds of
smoke.<br /><br /><strong>APOTHECARY TREE</strong> – the resident mad scientist,
mixing special brews that restore the weak to health or burn whole swaths of the
battlefield in explosive acid. Apothecaries can upgrade to Monks that chain
together rapid punches and channel arcane energies to heal and harm, or Shamans
who can manipulate the forces of life and death or sacrifice their allies to
damage foes.<br /><br /><img
